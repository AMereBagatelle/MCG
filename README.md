# MCG
This is my mod for a quick and easy storage of coordinates, so they don't have to be stored outside of the game. Often,
I found myself taking out a notepad to keep track of my coordinates.

You may ask, why not just use a minimap mod? I personally believe that most minimap mods are too cheaty, add too many
extra features, or are just too invasive in general.

This mod aims to solve the problems of bloat in storing coordinates. Coordinates are quick to access, and easy to see.
