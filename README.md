# SimpleCoordinates
This is my mod for a quick and easy storage of coordinates, so they don't have to be stored outside of the game.
Often, I found myself taking out a notepad to keep track of my coordinates.
Realized there was bound to be a better way to do this, so I made one.

You may ask, why not just use a minimap mod?
I decided that most minimap mods are too cheaty, add too many extra features, or are just too large in general.

This mod aims to solve the problems of bloat in storing coordinates.
The mod adds only 2 GUIs and 2 commands, at its current state.

## Use
This mod sets itself up, just drop it in your mods folder!
There are only 3 things to know.

1. `/writecoordinate` command.  This command uses a very basic interface, so that you can quickly take down your current coordinates.
2. `/removecoordinate` command.  This command just removes a coordinate by its name.
3. The GUI.  The GUI is opened with a hotkey, set in the Options > Controls menu.  Once you are there, the GUI is easy to understand.

Thanks for using my mod!  If you find any issues, just let me know.  Also, open a issue tagged with feature request if you want to suggest something.
