MCG provides quick and easy storage of coordinates, so they don't have to be stored outside of the game. Often, I found
myself taking out a notepad to keep track of my coordinates.

You may ask why not just use a minimap mod? I personally believe that full minimap mods add too many extra features or
get in the player's way in general.

This mod aims to solve the problems of bloat in storing coordinates. Coordinates are quick to access, and easy to see.
